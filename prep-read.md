# Problem solving:
## How to Solve Programming Problems?

### Common mistakes:
**the improper allocation of time:** spending upfront time to make sure something is done right, rather than diving right in.
 - one of most common mistakes is trying to start writing code as soon as possible. **You must resist this urge**:
 - trying to over solve the solution on the first iteration.  Keep it simple, don’t try to get fancy.

### steps to solve programming problems:

1. Read the problem completely twice.
2. Solve the problem manually with 3 sets of sample data.
3. Optimize the manual steps.
4. Write the manual steps as comments or pseudo-code.
5. Replace the comments or pseudo-code with real code.
6. Optimize the real code.

### “Busyness” Isn’t a Badge of Honor; It’s a Sign of Weakness:

 It takes discipline to not become “busy.”
If you let it, your world and the people around you will take all your time. Your time is not unlike your paycheck; if you don’t budget for things, you’ll have nothing left over by the end of the month.
This is how lives are wasted — by doing thankless work for ungrateful takers that didn’t deserve your time in the first place.
 When you’re busy, you are on autopilot. You can’t see the hours slipping away, time you’ll never get back. Most people prize “being busy.” They proclaim it with pride, as if it’s a badge of honor.

## How to think like a programmer:

step by step you can solve any problem.

in coding, you can follow these steps:
1. Try a solution.
2. If that doesn’t work, try another one.
3. If that doesn’t work, repeat step 2 until you luck out.

###  So, what should you do when you encounter a new problem?

- **Understand:** Know exactly what is being asked. Most hard problems are hard because you don’t understand them (hence why this is the first step).

- **Plan:** Don’t dive right into solving without a plan (and somehow hope you can muddle your way through). Plan your solution!.

- **Divide:** 
Do not try to solve one big problem. **You will cry :'(**

Instead, break it into sub-problems. These sub-problems are much easier to solve.

Then, solve each sub-problem one by one. Begin with the simplest. Simplest means you know the answer.

After that, simplest means this sub-problem being solved doesn’t depend on others being solved.

Once you solved every sub-problem, connect the dots.

Connecting all your “sub-solutions” will give you the solution to the original problem. Congratulations!

This technique is a cornerstone of problem-solving. **Remember it**.

- **Stuck?** don’t worry though, friend. This happens to everyone!

The difference is the best programmers/problem-solvers are more curious about bugs/errors than irritated.

In fact, here are three things to try when facing a whammy:

1. **Debug:**: Go step by step through your solution trying to find where you went wrong. Programmers call this debugging (in fact, this is all a debugger does).
2. **Reassess:** Take a step back. Look at the problem from another perspective. Is there anything that can be abstracted to a more general approach?
3. **Research:** Google will be your best friend . You read that right. No matter what problem you have, someone has probably solved it. Find that person/ solution. In fact, do this even if you solved the problem! (You can learn a lot from other people’s solutions). **Don't copy&paste it, learn from it**
