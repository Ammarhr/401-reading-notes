## Event Driven Programming:
-  **event-driven programming** is a programming paradigm in which the flow of the program is determined by events such as user actions (mouse clicks, key presses), sensor outputs, or messages from other programs or threads.

- One of the big benefits of **event-driven programming** is that itâ€™s very intuitive, flexible and naturally well-suited to applications whose control flow are based, not on its structure, but rather on internal or external events.

- **Event-driven programming** serves the user with the quickest and most accurate responses and this usually translates into better user experience and business gains.
 
- Because **event-driven programming** is an approach rather than a type of programming language, it can be practiced with any programming language.

### Event emitter:
 **Event emitter** is an object/method which triggers an event as soon as some action takes place so as to pass the cntrol to the parent function. **Ex:** Server is an event emitter in Node.Js programming. 

 - In **node.js** an event can be described simply as a string with a corresponding callback. An event can be "emitted" multiple times or you can choose to only listen for the first time it is emitted.
