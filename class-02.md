### Test-driven development (TDD):
**Test-driven development (TDD)** is a software development process that relies on the repetition of a very short development cycle. First, the developer writes an (initially failing) automated test case that defines a desired improvement or new function, then produces the minimum amount of code to pass that test, and finally refactors the new code to acceptable standards.

### Name 3 advantages to Test Driven Development:
1. Test Driven Development creates SOLID code.
2. Test Driven Development supports a clean interface.
3. Test Driven Development creates code that is maintainable, flexible, and easily extensible.

### What is one downside of Test Driven Development:

1. Big time investment: in a complicated cases you lose much time.
2. Additional Complexity: For complex cases your test cases are harder to calculate.
3. Design Impacts: a not clear design may inforce you to redo the test 

### In what case would you need to use beforeEach() or afterEach() in a test suite?
we use ``beforeEach() or afterEach()`` if we want to do a test many times

### Term:

#### Object-oriented programming (OOP):
**Object-oriented programming (OOP)** is a computer programming model that organizes software design around data, or objects, rather than functions and logic. An object can be defined as a data field that has unique attributes and behavior.

####  Jest:
**Jest** is a universal testing platform, with the ability to adapt to any **JavaScript** library or framework.

#### Continuous Integration (CI):
**Continuous Integration (CI)** is a development practice where developers integrate code into a shared repository frequently, preferably several times a day. 

####  UNIT TESTING:
**UNIT TESTING** is a level of software testing where individual units/ components of a software are tested. The purpose is to validate that each unit of the software performs as designed.
